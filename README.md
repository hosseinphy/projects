## Solidification process of sinterd powder Aluminum-based alloys
### Designed & implemented a high performance computing algorithm for large-scale simulations of a solidification during 3D Metal Printing process of mechanical parts, resulting in 35x speedup across 1024 cores by applying MPI techniques.
