<h2>Pattern formation in Reaction-Diffusion systems (e.g., flame front) - PhD McGill September 2017</h2>

<img src="./AMR.gif" align="left" width="600px"/>

<li>Developed finite difference C++ codes for large-scale parallel computing, achieved 10x speedup</li>
<li>Specialized and optimized the pre-existing Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code for simulations of heat/mass transfer in 2D &
     3D, (2 orders of magnitude speedup & reduced the computational cost and memory usage)
</li>

<h2>Solidification process of sintered powder Aluminum-based alloys - Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence, University of New Brunswick February 2018 - August 2021 </h2>
     
<li>Designed & implemented a high-performance computing algorithm for large-scale simulations of a solidification during 3D Metal Printing process of mechanical parts, resulting in 35x speedup across 1024 cores by applying MPI techniques. </li> 
     
<li>Initiated process automation that required to collect, interpret, and visualize more than 10TB of data during 3D printing simulation. Accelerated processing time 7-fold (from 14 to 2 days).</li>
