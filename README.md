<h2>Solidification process of sinterd powder Aluminum-based alloys - Marine Additive Manufacturing Centre of Excellence, University of New Brunswick Febreuary 2018 - August 2019 </h2>
     
<li>Designed & implemented a high performance computing algorithm for large-scale simulations of a solidification during 3D Metal Printing process of mechanical parts, resulting in 35x speedup across 1024 cores by applying MPI techniques.</li> 
     
<li>Initiated process automation that required to collect, interpret, and visualize more than 10TB of data during 3D printing simulation. Accelerated processing time 7-fold (from 14 to 2 days).</li> 
     
<li>Predict spatio-temporal patterns in different physical systems based on the processing parameters using Neural Network analysis assisting in design of new Functionally Graded Materials for specific functions & applications. Executed 40+ simulations using 2000+cores; collected and analyzed ~ 10TB of data.</li>
