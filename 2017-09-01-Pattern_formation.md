## Summary
Pattern forming in complex system has numerous applications in science and technology. One application, for instance, is their abilities to generate and propagate a respond to a small stimulus from the environment in a fast and reliable fashion. Reaction-diffusion system, as an excitable media, has two stable rest and excited states. Perturbations larger than the threshold may cause a large response, while small perturbations and noise decay immediately. Super-threshold perturbations lead via diffusion to propagation of fast reaction-diffusion waves that transmit information in a reliable fashion. Propagation of action potential in response to a small change in potential of the neural membrane, is a good example of this ability in neural networks of the brain!
